# RPS-with-GUI
Rock Paper Scissors game with a GUI with Python

This is a fairly simple game. On the top left you have two buttons (E and H) to select easy or hard modes. If you don't click one of those you get unlimited play, but right now it is kind of broken as if you start playing unlimited then select a mode it doesn't stick. 

This is a very early version that I have started, but I will be working on more as I go. This was mainly just a project for me to get started into Python and learn my way around. 

I also have a Discord Bot (not here) that plays rock paper scissors in my Discord channel. More about that on my website https://www.mrkrinle.com

I know it seems like a common theme here with the rock paper scissors, but that was just an idea that I have kind of latched onto getting started. There will be more of a variety in the future.
